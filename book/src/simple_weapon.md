# Simple Weapon

In this section will walk through making a simple projectile weapon, a sniper rifle. The sniper rifle will be a variation of the musket weapon.

## Planning

The sniper rifle weapon will be very similar to the musket weapon, but with two distinct differences. The sniper rifle will have:

- High shot speed
- Low fire rate
- Low ammunition

## Code

Open the "FishFight" directory in your editor of choice

### Create `sniper.rs` in `src/items`

Create a new rust file in `src/items` called `your_new_item.rs`. I'll name the item file for this example `sniper.rs`.



- `src/items.rs`: Add Item entry to ITEMS array
- `src/main.rs`: Add resources to Resources?
- `src/items`: Add file for weapon or add spawn in another weapon file

## Assets

`assets/Whale`: Add textures for weapon

## Testing

- `levels/test_level.json`: Add item to test level
